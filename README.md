### Source Information

This website is built with

- [SvelteKit (Frontend Framework)](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Slickscroll (Scroll Effects)](https://github.com/Musab-Hassan/slickscrolljs)
- [Anime (Animations)](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime)
- [Three.js (3D Effects)](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
- [Netlify (Hosting)](https://docs.netlify.com/get-started/)

### Developing

The site is just a regular SvelteKit project, with ssr disabled.

For development, start the vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

_Note: Due to migration from Rollup, HMR breaks the site. You have to do a full reload if you modify any components or TS files._

For production, build the site:

```bash
npm run build
```
